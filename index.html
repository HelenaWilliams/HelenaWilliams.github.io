        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>I'm a fourth-year college student, looking for a job for when I graduate (June 2025). I'm Brooklyn born and raised, but I've been studying at the University of Chicago for the past 3 years, and I've spent several months in both Seattle and Paris--relocation is always an option for me. During my time in college, I've had the opportunity to take a number of fascinating classes, and have also held several jobs in various fields of computer science. Juggling these jobs with being a full-time college student (and attempting a double major!) has never been easy, but I've continued to succeed regardless. Currently, I split my time between two positions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>UChicago SUPERgroup</b></li>
            <li><b>iD Tech</b></li>
        </ul>        
    </div>

        <h1>SUPERgroup</h1>
        <p>As a research assistant for UChicago's SUPERgroup lab, I've been helping with two important security/usability studies. Since April 2023, I've taken part in almost every step of academic research, from preparing experimental materials to writing up results for publication. During this time, I've made use of Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, bash, and MySQL, among other technologies. I've also developed extensive familiarity with GitHub and Google Sheets/Excel. My work has been crucial in obtaining high-quality data, and in drawing conclusions about its implications. Whether it's developing a pipeline for Markov Model training/testing with Monte Carlo sampling, analyzing outputs from large language models, or pulling an all-nighter to finish manually grading several thousand participant responses, I have served SUPERgroup with determination and skill, even during the academic term.</p>

        <h1>iD Tech</h1>
        <p>As a programming instructor for iD Tech, I teach subjects such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Roblox/Lua, and Cybersecurity. Every lesson, I'm faced with the unique challenge of communicating difficult concepts to students from all ages and backgrounds. In a single day, I might teach 2-4 different subjects, to students ranging in age from 7 to 19. Some students have never written code before--in these cases, I seek to inspire the same love of programming I posess--while others might have entire codebases I've never seen, but still require useful feedback and assistance within minutes of a lesson starting. It's this diversity of experiences that makes this job both quite difficult and quite rewarding: some of the curricula I've crafted, in the form of programming projects, is in the "Projects" tab of this website. I've taught over 100 lessons to date, but it never gets old, and the skills I have gained from this job continue to help me outside the office.</p>

        <h1>What Experience Do I Have?</h1>
        <p>In addition to my previously-mentioned jobs, I've held several other positions of interest.</p>
