        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm a fourth-year college student, looking for a job for when I graduate in June of 2025. I'm Brooklyn born and raised, but I've been studying at the University of Chicago for the past 3 years, and I've spent several months in both Seattle and Paris--relocation is always an option for me! During my time in college, I've had the opportunity to take a number of fascinating classes, and have also held several jobs in various fields of computer science. Juggling these jobs with being a full-time college student (and attempting a double major!) has never been easy, but I've continued to succeed regardless. Currently, I split my time between two positions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>UChicago SUPERgroup</b></li>
            <li><b>iD Tech</b></li>
        </ul>        
    </div>
    <div class="centered" style="top:180vw;left:13%;">
        <img src="assets/SUPERgroup.png" alt="UChicago SUPERgroup logo." style="width:20vw; border-radius:20px;">
    </div>
    <div class="centered" style="top:180vw;left:87%">
        <img src="assets/iDTech.png" alt="iD Tech logo." style="width:20vw; border-radius:20px;">

        <h1>SUPERgroup</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As a research assistant for UChicago's SUPERgroup lab, I've been helping with two important security/usability studies. Since April 2023, I've taken part in almost every step of academic research, from preparing experimental materials to writing up results for publication. During this time, I've made use of Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, bash, and MySQL, among other technologies. I've also developed extensive familiarity with GitHub and Google Sheets/Excel. My work has been crucial in obtaining high-quality data, and in drawing conclusions about its implications. Whether it's developing a pipeline for Markov Model training/testing with Monte Carlo sampling, analyzing outputs from large language models, or pulling an all-nighter to finish manually grading several thousand participant responses, I have served SUPERgroup with determination and skill, even during the academic term.</p>

    <div class="right txtbox" style="position:absolute; top:247vw;">
        <h1>iD Tech</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As a programming instructor for iD Tech, I teach subjects such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Roblox/Lua, and Cybersecurity. Every lesson, I'm faced with the unique challenge of communicating difficult concepts to students from all ages and backgrounds. In a single day, I might teach 2-4 different subjects, to students ranging in age from 7 to 19. Some students have never written code before--in these cases, I seek to inspire the same love of programming I posess--while others might have entire codebases I've never seen, but still require useful feedback and assistance within minutes of a lesson starting. It's this diversity of experiences that makes this job both quite difficult and quite rewarding: some of the curricula I've crafted, in the form of programming projects, is in the "Projects" tab of this website. I've taught over 100 lessons to date, but it never gets old, and the skills I have gained from this job continue to help me outside the office.</p>

    <div class="centered txtbox" style="position:absolute; top:287vw;">
        <h1>What Experience Do I Have?</h1>
        <p>In addition to my previously-mentioned jobs, I've held several other positions of interest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left txtbox" style="top:294vw;width:60vw;">
        <h1>NOAA Machine Learning Intern</h1>
        <p>Summer 2022</p>
        <p>I spent the summer after my first year of college interning at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, after securing a Metcalf grant from UChicago. I helped to analyze photographs of Arctic ice floes to identify seals of various species and ages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right txtbox" style="top:314vw;width:50vw;">
        <h1>csDojo Tutoring</h1>
        <p>Spring 2020-June 2021</p>
        <p>During the quarantine, I volunteered at my school's csDojo, where I provided younger students with programming assistance after school. I typically assisted students in Advanced Placement classes and introductory classes with Java/NetLogo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left txtbox" style="top:334vw;width:50vw;">
        <h1>Teaching Assistant</h1>
        <p>Spring 2020, Spring 2021</p>
        <p>During the quarantine, I had the chance to help the teachers who had helped me--by volunteering as a Teaching Assistant. I served as a more approachable and available source of information, feedback, and guidance for two semesters.</p>

    <div class="centered txtbox" style="position:absolute; top:373vw;">
        <h1>What Else Do I Do?</h1>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While I'm a researcher and instructor from 9-5, I have a variety of other interests, which I have continued chasing during my time in college. 
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the most important would be my second major--French. As far back as high school, I won a gold medal from Le Grand Concours National French Contest, and when I came to college, I opted to add French as a second major. I've even been lucky enough to study abroad in Paris during autumn 2023!
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, I have several other hobbies that keep me entertained. I love exploring whatever city I happen to be living in--many of the photos on this website were taken during bike rides, or while riding ferries along the coastline. Also, I enjoy cooking and baking for my friends: doing so offers me the rare chance to create something physical, and to make happy memories with the people I care about. You can find photos under the "Projects" tab!
